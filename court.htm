    <p align="justify"><font><strong>The Court Referral Program is an alternate
    sentencing option for Superior, Municipal, Traffic and Juvenile Courts.&nbsp; The court
    has the option to assign community service hours in addition to, or in lieu of,
    incarceration and/or a fine.&nbsp; A community service sentence orders restitution by an
    offender through helping his or her community.&nbsp; Usually, the prescribed service is
    provided to governmental and non-profit agencies, suggesting symbolically that the
    offender is servicing the good of the general public and compensating society for having
    committed a crime.&nbsp; Authority resides under the jurisdiction of the criminal system.</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font><strong>The program carefully screens individuals before referring them to
    the agency to perform community service.&nbsp; They then provide follow-up and record
    keeping of the hours worked. &nbsp; The Court Referral Program maintains branches in
    Bakersfield and Shafter.</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font><strong>Many agencies throughout Kern County utilize the program
    to supplement staff shortages and solve many of the daily operational problems that they
    all encounter. &nbsp; Agencies such as United Way, Food Bank, Kern County Soccer Park,
    Jason's Retreat, Salvation Army, Bethany Services/Bakersfield Homeless Shelter, City of
    Bakersfield Sanitation, Kern County Fairgrounds, Boys and Girls Club, Golden Empire
    Gleaners, Friendship House and Goodwill Industries are a few of the agencies that receive
    assistance through this program.&nbsp; Volunteer positions for the Court Referral Program
    range from janitorial duties to professional services rendered by court ordered
    volunteers. &nbsp; Clients and agencies find this program equally beneficial and vital to
    our community.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font><strong>Additional benefits of the Court Referral Program:</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font><strong>- the person can often continue at his or her job without
      going to jail, thereby keeping the family together.</strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font><strong>- the person learns to give of him or herself.</strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font><strong>- establishes a work ethic for those who have never known
      this sense of accomplishment.</strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font><strong>- volunteer work can raise self image.</strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font><strong>- tremendous saving to the taxpayer by eliminating the
      cost of incarceration.</strong></font></p>
                        <p><strong><font>- community service can be transferred 
      from any court jurisdiction to the Volunteer Center of Kern County.</font></strong></p>
