    <div class="div-block">R.S.V.P. is a national network of more than 500,000 Americans who are ages 55 and above, enabling seniors to volunteers their experience and know-how with public and private non-profit agencies, with additional assistance being provided to governmental and specific health related agencies as well.</div>
    <div class="div-block">The purpose of the program is to "empower older individuals to contribute to their communities through volunteer service, enhance the lives of the volunteers and those whom they serve and provide communities with valuable services."  The volunteers bring a wealth of talent to help solve local problems affecting their own communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their are no education, experience or income requirements. R.S.V.P. matches the interests and abilities of the senior volunteers with rewarding part-time opportunities in our area.</div>
    <div class="div-block">Though R.S.V.P., retired persons are finding fulfillment by assisting in literacy programs, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, day care centers, health departments, domestic abuse hot lines, schools, museums, teen advocate programs, child abuse programs, teen pregnancy education programs, physically and developmentally challenged programs, mentor projects and hundreds of other worthwhile programs throughout Kern County.</div>
    <div class="div-block">R.S.V.P. volunteers participated in a wide variety of projects and programs, addressing critical community issues ranging from, but not limited to child abuse, drug and alcohol addiction, AIDS awareness, care/housing, tax preparation for low income families and individuals, gang affiliation and intervention, elder abuse, homelessness, mental illness and cultural awareness issues.</div>
    <div class="div-block">R.S.V.P. partners with other agencies in our area, playing a vital role in providing the much needed manpower to assist agencies in delivering services. Senior volunteerism is extremely valuable; the older citizen has so much to offer others and in doing so, helps them become older not old.</div>
