    500,000 Americans who are ages 55 and above, enabling seniors to volunteers their
    experience and know-how with public and private non-profit agencies, with additional
    assistance being provided to governmental and specific health related agencies as well.</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><strong>The purpose of the program is to &quot;empower older individuals
    to contribute to their communities through volunteer service, enhance the lives of the
    volunteers and those whom they serve and provide communities with valuable services.&quot;
    &nbsp; The volunteers bring a wealth of talent to help solve local problems affecting
    their own communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their are no education, experience or
    income requirements.&nbsp; R.S.V.P. matches the interests and abilities of the senior
    volunteers with rewarding part-time opportunities in our area.</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><strong>Though R.S.V.P., retired persons are finding fulfillment
    by assisting in literacy programs, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, day care centers,
    health departments, domestic abuse hot lines, schools, museums, teen advocate programs,
    child abuse programs, teen pregnancy education programs, physically and developmentally
    challenged programs, mentor projects and hundreds of other worthwhile programs throughout
    Kern County.</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><strong>R.S.V.P. volunteers participated in a wide variety of
    projects and programs, addressing critical community issues ranging from, but not limited
    to child abuse, drug and alcohol addiction, AIDS awareness, care/housing, tax preparation
    for low income families and individuals, gang affiliation and intervention, elder abuse,
    homelessness, mental illness and cultural awareness issues.</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><strong>R.S.V.P. partners with other agencies in our area,
    playing a vital role in providing the much needed manpower to assist agencies in
    delivering services.&nbsp; Senior volunteerism is extremely valuable; the older citizen
    has so much to offer others and in doing so, helps them become older not old.</strong></font></p>
